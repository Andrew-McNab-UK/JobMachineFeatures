The wlcg-wn-env-{pbs,torque} packages consists of a set of scripts to set up
the $JOBFEATURES directory. This directory is generated by the prologue.user script
and contains the following files:
  jobstart   (job start time)
  cpu_limit  (maximum CPU limit available, in seconds)
  wall_limit (maximum walltime limit available, in seconds)
A job can calculate the remaining wall time doing
  now() - $jobstart + $wall_limit


The purpose of each of the files in this packages is:
- prologue.user    : set up the $JOBFEATURES file
- epilogue.user    : clean up the $JOBFEATURES file
- wlcg-wn-env.conf : configuration file
- wlcg-wn-env.sh   : set the environment variable JOBFEATURES

The wlcg-wn-env.conf can be used to change the default location of the 
$JOBFEATURES file. If this config file is missing the scripts default to
  ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/jobfeatures.${PBS_JOBID}

There is no wlcg-wn-env.csh script as the JOBFEATURES environment variable 
is inherited from the PBS wrapper scripts, which are bash-based.


The only difference between the wlcg-wn-env-pbs and wlcg-wn-env-torque packages
is the location of the 'mom_priv' directory. For older version of the PBS/Torque
client (up to v2.3) the mom_priv directory was found under
  /var/spool/pbs/mom_priv
With the EPEL packaged version of the Torque 2.5 client this was changed to
  /var/torque/mom_priv.
